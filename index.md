## Throughout my participation in INTEG 375, a course on Data Visualization, at the University of Waterloo, I gained various insight in creating informative and thought-provoking visualizations. This portfolio highlights the work that best represents the knowledge and experience I have gained from this course. <br/><br/>-Jillian Anderson


### The Visualizations

Below you can find 14 sections, containing a total of 15 visualizations, presenting information regarding topics from air travel to foreign aid, poverty to trains, and politics to comic books. Each section contains the visualization(s) paired with a discussion meant to tell a story surrounding the visualization. Accompanying these pieces are reflections, lessons learned, R code and detailed descriptions of the process of creating the visualizations. 

All these visualizations were produced in R, using libraries such as ggplot2[^1], dpylr[^2], igraph[^3], reshape2[^4], and foreign[^5]. Much of the design has been informed by Stephen Few's "Show Me the Numbers"[^6], a read I recommend for anyone interested in data visualization. And while the data for each visualization is specifically referenced within its section, I would like to say most of this data has come from open source datasets, published academic papers, or government reports.
