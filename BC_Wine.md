### The Story
The above graph shows the difference in price

This graph uses a data set from British Columbiaâ€™s open data portal and contains the prices of products sold at BC Liquor Stores. I have focused on the price of wine at these stores, summarizing the data by country of origin for each wine. I have normalized the prices to indicate the price for one litre of a product.   

From this data, I think there may be an interesting discussion to be had surrounding the impact of a Country's "Brand" on the price its wine will sell for. I think it would be interesting to see characteristics, if any, lead to French wine being significantly more expensive then any other wine.   

When first looking at the prices, the mean price for French wine was much higher than any other wine, as I had anticipated. After digging around in the data a bit more, I found that many of the means I was getting were unable to accurately depict the distribution. So I chose to use a box plot instead. As we have discussed before, I chose not to include whiskers, as most people are unsure how to read them. Further, I provided a key at the top.   


I should also talk about the problem I am addressing here. What needs to be known? 

The story can go here. I should explain what I am trying to tell. How I have highlighted it with this graph. And then provide one or two discussion topics and questions for this graph. 


### The Process
This graph was produced using the "BC Liquor Store Product Price List"[^1] made available on [opendatabc.ca](https://www.opendatabc.ca/). This dataset contains the prices of 5,563 products sold in BC Liquor Stores, as well as the characteristics of the products. These characteristics included category (ie. Wine, Spirit, Beer), alcohol content, and origin country. 

Once I had acquired this dataset, I was able to begin exploring it. I soon found this dataset listed over 3,500 wines, originating from a wide variety of countries. I was intrigued by this and decided to compare the prices of wine based on their origin country. 

To begin, I needed to find the price per Litre of each wine which was sold. This was done by first finding the number of litres with each sale, by multiplying the number of containers per sale by the number of litres per container. From here, I was able to divide the price of the product by the total litres of wine to get the final price per litre. 

After I found the price per litre of wine, I began comparing measures of centrality across countries of origin. I began by simply comparing the means between countries. This showed wines originating in France had an average price/L of almost $300, while all other countries had means below $120. After continuing to explore the raw data, I found these simple means were unable to tell the full story of wine prices. For example, France has a total of nine wines which cost over $3000 per liter, making their average wine price seem like a bargain. I decided there was perhaps a better story tell using the price distributions rather than a simple mean. 

Thus, I decided to create a boxplot to present this data. I soon realized there were multiple countries from which only a few wines originated from. I chose to exclude those countries which supplied fewer than 15 wines to the BC Liquor Stores. This was done in an effort to ensure the distributions were representative of wine industries in these nations, rather than a small group of wines. 

When making my boxplot, I chose to exclude the whiskers from the diagram. This was done to ensure I was able to communicate with my audience. As Stephen Few mentions, relatively few members of the public have been taught to read box plots, and thus an effort should be made to ensure their clarity and simplicity[^2]. To address this further, I have chosen to include a boxplot guide with my visualization. This helps ensure readers understand what I have presented, as may serve to teach readers who are unfamiliar with boxplots. Other design decisions, such as removing horizontal gridlines and unnecessary axis titles, have been done in an effort to minimize non-data ink.

### The Learning
This graph was my first attempt at creating a boxplot. While I am happy with the final result, I encountered a few unexpected bumps along the way. Initially, I had hoped to include the full range of wine prices, excluding outliers, for each country. This was my goal, as I felt readers were much more likely to understand minimum and maximum, rather than percentiles. However, these are typically encoded using whiskers, a feature I was hoping to remove. Despite looking for alternatives, I was unable to find a way to turn whiskers into extensions of the box. Instead, I opted to include a guide for how to read my boxplots. This helps ensure readers are aware of the statistics I am displaying.
